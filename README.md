# Daily Commit Challenge
Welcome to my daily commit challenge! The goal of this project is to commit to this repository every day, building up a rich history of my progress as a developer. Each day, I will work on a small project or learning task, commit my changes, and push them to GitHub.

## Goals
1. Build up a daily commit history to showcase my progress as a developer
2. Improve my skills and knowledge in programming, data science, and machine learning
3. Explore new concepts and projects to broaden my experience and knowledge base

## Ideas for Daily Commits
Here are some ideas for projects and tasks that you can work on to commit incrementally each day:
1. Solve a coding challenge or problem
2. Work on a small programming project
3. Learn machine learning concepts and algorithms
4. Continue ML and DL learning on Coursera and DeepLearning.ai
5. Refactor existing code to make it more efficient or easier to read
6. Contribute to an open-source project
7. Review and update documentation for an existing project

## Projects
Here are my current projects that I am working on to complete the daily commit challenge:
1. LeetCode problems
2. Machine Learning projects
3. Data Science projects

## Acknowledgments
